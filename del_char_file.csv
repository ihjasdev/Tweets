UMadhavii,r_evarts asiri_h23 ParliamentLK Well now you know 
UMadhavii,When I saw this amazing capture by my colleague asiri_h23 I thought of sharing a small ParliamentLK fact with you This lamp is lit to signify that sittings are ongoing when nightfall So if you go past Parliament and see this that means Parliament is still on httpstcoG0PDUT3w4a
UMadhavii,shashikaLB nuzlyMN True this  I too personally think we often tend to not ask the right questions This is indeed unfortunate
UMadhavii,shashikaLB nuzlyMN The intentions of the host may be questionable  Any marketing is good marketing they say But what I was trying to highlight is that people reps are in Parliament because we put them there So unless we reelect they are answerable and they should
UMadhavii,Amazing httpstcobpPvdYOt54
UMadhavii,It is important to listen to people you dont agree with in politics rather than bullying the media personnel facilitating the discussion If you do not listen and if you do not question how are you going to know better to decide better  5n
UMadhavii,or you may not But that does not negate the fact that they are representing the general public in Parliament amp the people put them there What is required is to ask the right questions and make better decisions   4n
UMadhavii,"Just to add I see nuzlyMN being thrashed for having MP Namal httpstcoHImcTQqERM
This is very similar to my experience when LKaskMP recently had Minister Keheliya_R in his capacity as Health Minister to talk about periodpoverty You may like a certain politician 3n"
UMadhavii,engagement with the people reps can definitely improve I mean I see revolutionary ideas suggestions and questions here on Twitter but when the MP or the Minister actually sits with us to talk to the people with no filters the same enthusiasm is lacking  22
UMadhavii,We did have RajapaksaNamal when he was the Minister of Youth and Sports along with fernandoharin on youth participation in politics ParliamentLK LKaskMP spaces allow anyone here to engage with their reps But unfortunately in my experience the right questions and  12 httpstcoX6lbw40nJ0

UMadhavii,excellence or a certain profession Its unfortunate that our education system is like the hunger games and the product we put out into society after  years of such primary and secondary education is quite questionable 22
UMadhavii,Well those I know are doing pretty well and at this point in life pretty content Some migrated Some are colleagues in Parliament Some are stay home Moms My Uni bestie does a cake business Success is about balance It also does not have to limit to educational 12 httpstcoiPqgaZvpYN
UMadhavii,The committee drew attention to the existing problems due to the absence of a casino regulatory authority The chairman said that no casino license is granted without a casino regulatory body in any country in the world httpstco3adaHOXq7w
UMadhavii,ndyagif Its the same as colombo school old boys old girls elitism Such societal  prejudice is deep rooted and not very prone to change Unfortunately this stems from our education system itself
UMadhavii,Ru173418052 This is not an issue with the major Its an issue with curriculum Every major has great potential and ample of opportunity if executed right Looking down on the major is not the way to go
UMadhavii,ever
UMadhavii,development The success of a person is not always determined by the stream or subject Its what people make out of it I know many who did bio or maths who resorted to Arts to qualify into a local uni or end up doing law 66
UMadhavii,Our society and parents would make a doughnut outta the child if it was every to be in SL The mentality is very similar to ආ Arts ද අප ළමය නම බයන මතසන Life is not about what stream or subject one choose Its about skill attitudes character and personality  5n

UMadhavii,system as well as our society Not only do we look down on the Arts our society also look down on vocational qualifications Doesnt matter if youre a budding enterprenure or has great skill in a certain industry not having a degree is looked down on3n
UMadhavii,me to do whatever I wanted to do When I enetered Arts Fac Col uni I did International Relations Sociology and Mass Com Has life gone wrong for me I think not So why not Arts  This doctor engineer lawyer mentality is exactly what is wrong with our education 2n
UMadhavii,I did Arts I did political Sc logic and Sinhala for my local ALs Doing such subjects werent as posh as doing Bio or Maths when I was schooling Only dumb kids resorted to Arts A majority of parents thought the same I am glad mine did not and allowed 1n httpstcomNYWsjwBjD
