2022-12-29 12:07:33+00:00,kulanthisilva,"@Gianderose1 Ah, that’s your problem! You might want to check out what the OT says about those who supported GR and how they’re now cheering for RW. So you do the math and figure out why and how."

2022-12-29 10:22:34+00:00,kulanthisilva,@Pro_JeyR @Urisco Fake news is dangerous
2022-12-29 09:52:10+00:00,kulanthisilva,"@aruni_t Many politicians from Sirisena’s administration were stigmatised as incompetent. Sirisena did not allow anyone to work because he was insecure, which reflected poorly on those who worked with him."
2022-12-29 09:35:49+00:00,kulanthisilva,@Gianderose1 Census and statistics. You can try Googling for a start.
2022-12-29 09:34:35+00:00,kulanthisilva,@lunaberryx I do 😌
2022-12-29 09:34:15+00:00,kulanthisilva,"@kekenow4ever I think in RW’s case, people are just being relieved because we went through a lot in such a short span."
2022-12-29 09:31:10+00:00,kulanthisilva,"@aruni_t I think it’s mostly politicians who think they can sway people by spreading rumours and insults, but today’s voters don’t respond kindly to such nonsense. Moreover, voters have no way of knowing beforehand who will disappoint them later on, and GR’s case was one of its kind."

2022-12-29 08:59:07+00:00,kulanthisilva,"@Keshara__ @GotabayaR Yes, I, too, liked him though I have never voted in my life. His arrogance went against him."
2022-12-29 08:57:28+00:00,kulanthisilva,"@Krysifuss Yes, and some people say irrational things about the government in order to fit in with a certain crowd like the international community, NGOs, etc"
2022-12-29 08:44:54+00:00,kulanthisilva,"Closer to 7m out of 16m registered voters supported GR but grew tired of his policies and now support RW. These rapid shifts in opinion indicate that Sri Lankans are not ignorant and no longer accept being misled. In my opinion, this is progress &amp; not even slightly hilarious. https://t.co/QHkHJPR8Wl"
2022-12-29 06:38:20+00:00,kulanthisilva,"When all of the logical, rational arguments are exhausted, and there is nothing left to say, personal attacks follow."
