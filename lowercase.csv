elonmusk,cb_doge scottadamssays not enough
elonmusk,scottadamssays my reason for declining the davos invitation was not because i thought they were engaged in diabolical scheming but because it sounded boring af lol
elonmusk,scottadamssays its not some illuminati plot to destroy humanity but rather an extension of the wellmeaning environmental sustainability movement that has gone too far
elonmusk,"scottadamssays i dont think we should divide issues semirandomly into left and right tribes as it inhibits critical thinking

the idea that there are too many people generally stems from the axiomatic flaw that earths environment cant sustain its current population"

elonmusk,pmarca despite these glaring issues twitter nonetheless had an internal slack channel unironically called fauci fan club 
elonmusk,"pmarca gainoffunction in this context is just another way of saying bioweapon 

some good nuggets in article important to note that fauci authored 2012 paper arguing for gainoffunction research

obama wisely put this on pause but fauci restarted it

"
elonmusk,"pmarca almost no one seems to realize that the head of bioethics at nih  the person who is supposed to make sure that fauci behaves ethically  is his wife

umadhavii,r_evarts asiri_h23 parliamentlk well now you know 
umadhavii,when i saw this amazing capture by my colleague asiri_h23 i thought of sharing a small parliamentlk fact with you this lamp is lit to signify that sittings are ongoing when nightfall so if you go past parliament and see this that means parliament is still on 
umadhavii,shashikalb nuzlymn true this  i too personally think we often tend to not ask the right questions this is indeed unfortunate
umadhavii,shashikalb nuzlymn the intentions of the host may be questionable  any marketing is good marketing they say but what i was trying to highlight is that people reps are in parliament because we put them there so unless we reelect they are answerable and they should
umadhavii,amazing 
umadhavii,it is important to listen to people you dont agree with in politics rather than bullying the media personnel facilitating the discussion if you do not listen and if you do not question how are you going to know better to decide better  5n
umadhavii,or you may not but that does not negate the fact that they are representing the general public in parliament amp the people put them there what is required is to ask the right questions and make better decisions   4n
umadhavii,just to add i see nuzlymn being thrashed for having mp namal this is very similar to my experience when lkaskmp recently had minister keheliya_r in his capacity as health minister to talk about periodpoverty you may like a certain politician 3n
umadhavii,engagement with the people reps can definitely improve i mean i see revolutionary ideas suggestions and questions here on twitter but when the mp or the minister actually sits with us to talk to the people with no filters the same enthusiasm is lacking  22
umadhavii,we did have rajapaksanamal when he was the minister of youth and sports along with fernandoharin on youth participation in politics parliamentlk lkaskmp spaces allow anyone here to engage with their reps but unfortunately in my experience the right questions and  12

umadhavii,excellence or a certain profession its unfortunate that our education system is like the hunger games and the product we put out into society after  years of such primary and secondary education is quite questionable 22
umadhavii,well those i know are doing pretty well and at this point in life pretty content some migrated some are colleagues in parliament some are stay home moms my uni bestie does a cake business success is about balance it also does not have to limit to educational 12 
umadhavii,the committee drew attention to the existing problems due to the absence of a casino regulatory authority the chairman said that no casino license is granted without a casino regulatory body in any country in the world 
umadhavii,ndyagif its the same as colombo school old boys old girls elitism such societal  prejudice is deep rooted and not very prone to change unfortunately this stems from our education system itself
umadhavii,ru173418052 this is not an issue with the major its an issue with curriculum every major has great potential and ample of opportunity if executed right looking down on the major is not the way to go
umadhavii,ever
umadhavii,development the success of a person is not always determined by the stream or subject its what people make out of it i know many who did bio or maths who resorted to arts to qualify into a local uni or end up doing law 66
umadhavii,our society and parents would make a doughnut outta the child if it was every to be in sl the mentality is very similar to ආ arts ද අප ළමය නම බයන මතසන life is not about what stream or subject one choose its about skill attitudes character and personality  5n
umadhavii,"i came accross this on shark tank where a 17 year old is doing great business selling doughnuts 
4n"
umadhavii,system as well as our society not only do we look down on the arts our society also look down on vocational qualifications doesnt matter if youre a budding enterprenure or has great skill in a certain industry not having a degree is looked down on3n
umadhavii,me to do whatever i wanted to do when i enetered arts fac col uni i did international relations sociology and mass com has life gone wrong for me i think not so why not arts  this doctor engineer lawyer mentality is exactly what is wrong with our education 2n
umadhavii,i did arts i did political sc logic and sinhala for my local als doing such subjects werent as posh as doing bio or maths when i was schooling only dumb kids resorted to arts a majority of parents thought the same i am glad mine did not and allowed 1n

kulanthisilva,pro_jeyr urisco fake news is dangerous
kulanthisilva,aruni_t many politicians from sirisenas administration were stigmatised as incompetent sirisena did not allow anyone to work because he was insecure which reflected poorly on those who worked with him
kulanthisilva,gianderose1 census and statistics you can try googling for a start
kulanthisilva,lunaberryx i do 
kulanthisilva,kekenow4ever i think in rws case people are just being relieved because we went through a lot in such a short span
kulanthisilva,aruni_t i think its mostly politicians who think they can sway people by spreading rumours and insults but todays voters dont respond kindly to such nonsense moreover voters have no way of knowing beforehand who will disappoint them later on and grs case was one of its kind

kulanthisilva,krysifuss yes and some people say irrational things about the government in order to fit in with a certain crowd like the international community ngos etc
kulanthisilva,closer to 7m out of 16m registered voters supported gr but grew tired of his policies and now support rw these rapid shifts in opinion indicate that sri lankans are not ignorant and no longer accept being misled in my opinion this is progress amp not even slightly hilarious 
kulanthisilva,when all of the logical rational arguments are exhausted and there is nothing left to say personal attacks follow
kulanthisilva,urisco are all your facts verified or are you just rehashing old media reports
